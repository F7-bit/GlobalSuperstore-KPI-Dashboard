## üìñ Data Storytelling

> As the business scales globally, over 178,000 orders have been placed, with most purchases made by loyal, returning customers. Consumer segments drive the bulk of revenue, particularly in the technology category. However, not all growth is equal. By examining discount patterns, we see a hidden leak in profitability. While discounts boost order volume, steep cuts erode margins. Shipment analysis reveals that most deliveries fall into the 2‚Äì4 day window, with ‚ÄúSame Day‚Äù shipping being the most reliable for express orders. Finally, a global map of shipping costs helps pinpoint logistic inefficiencies in countries like Australia and Argentina.

Each chart was crafted to guide business decisions ‚Äî be it optimizing discounts, adjusting inventory, or restructuring shipping contracts.
